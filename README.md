## How we built it

This project serves as a library that can be imported by organizations to automate the process of generating and managing insurance contracts. It offers a flexible framework that allows organizations to customize and tailor the functionality according to their specific needs. Here are some key points about how this project was built:

1. Modular Design and Customization: The project follows a modular architecture, providing a set of base smart contracts that can be extended and overridden as needed. Organizations can import the library and inherit from the base contracts to create their own insurance policies. By overriding virtual functions in the base contracts, organizations can implement custom logic and rules specific to their insurance products.

2. Policy Generation and Management: The library includes a PolicyGenerator contract that acts as a factory for creating insurance policies. Organizations can use this contract to deploy customized insurance policies by passing the required parameters and policy-specific details. The generated policies are independent smart contracts with their own addresses, allowing organizations to manage them individually.

3. External Claim Verification: The project does not impose any specific means for verifying insurance claims. Instead, it provides a framework for organizations to integrate their own mechanisms for claim verification. Organizations can implement their own verification processes and interfaces within their customized insurance contracts, leveraging external data sources, oracles, or APIs to validate and process insurance claims.

4. Flexibility and Extensibility: The library is designed to provide a foundation for building diverse insurance products. It offers a range of virtual functions that can be overridden to incorporate custom business rules and validation mechanisms. Organizations can adapt the provided code to meet their specific requirements, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in the automation and management of insurance contracts.

5. Automation with Chainlink Keepers: The project leverages Chainlink Keepers to automate various tasks and processes within the insurance contract lifecycle. Organizations can set up automated workflows triggered by specific events or time-based conditions. For example, they can schedule policy renewals, trigger premium payments, or initiate claim settlements based on predefined conditions, all facilitated by Chainlink Keepers.

6. Price Conversion with Chainlink Price Feeds: To handle accurate and up-to-date price conversions within the insurance contracts, the project integrates Chainlink Price Feeds. Organizations can utilize these price feeds to fetch reliable and decentralized market data for various assets or currencies. This ensures that premium calculations claim payouts and other financial transactions within the insurance contracts are based on accurate and reliable price information.

7. External API Calls via Chainlink: The project's library enables organizations to make external API calls seamlessly via Chainlink. This functionality allows insurance contracts to interact with external systems and retrieve relevant data required for policy underwriting, claim validation, or other business processes. By leveraging Chainlink's Oracle network, organizations can securely and reliably integrate external data sources, APIs, or services into their insurance contracts, enhancing their functionality and efficiency.

By incorporating Chainlink Keepers, Price Feeds, and the ability to make external API calls via Chainlink, the project's library empowers organizations with advanced automation capabilities, accurate price conversions, and seamless integration with external data sources. This ensures the robustness and reliability of the insurance contracts while offering flexibility in managing complex insurance processes.

By importing this library, organizations can streamline their insurance operations, automate policy generation, and implement their own rules for claim verification. It empowers organizations to tailor the insurance process to their unique needs while providing a solid foundation for building and managing insurance contracts efficiently.
